# Static Error Pages
## Overview
This project is inspired by an existing project that focused solely on creating a custom 404 error page. In contrast, I have expanded the scope to include all common 400 and 500 HTTP error codes, providing a comprehensive suite of error pages.

For reference, the original project can be found here: [Original Project Link](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/colorlib-404-customizer/tree/master/templates/template_12).

# Static Error Pages :prohibited:

## Overview :pushpin:

The `static-error-pages` repository provides a full set of customizable static HTML pages for handling common HTTP 400 and 500 error codes. This project expands on the idea of a singular custom 404 page to encompass a broader range of error responses, ensuring that your web application can handle errors gracefully and informatively.

## Features ‚úÖ

- **Comprehensive Error Handling:** Covers all common 400 and 500 HTTP error codes.
- **Customizable:** Easy to edit HTML and CSS to match your branding.
- **Easy to Deploy:** Static files that can be served by any standard web server.

## Inspired By üëç

This project is inspired by an [existing project](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/colorlib-404-customizer/tree/master/templates/template_12) that created a custom 404 error page. We have taken it a step further by covering a wide array of HTTP error responses.
